# Seed-Based-Deanonymization
Source code is available in Project1_final.py file. Code is written in local environment, So to execute this python file, 3 file paths has to be updated in main method.

 1. seed_G1 takes seed_G1.edgelist file path.
 2. seed_G2 takes seed_G1.edgelist file path.
 3. seed_node_pairs takes path for seed_node_pairs.txt file. 

After updating these file paths, Project1_final.py can be executed from terminal using command python Project1_final.py or from any editor like vscode. 

The execution takes around 15 min for given data and output is generated in muppallaProject1Output.txt file which will be generated in the same location from which python file is executed.
